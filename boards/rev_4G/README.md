Large Board - Efinix Trion project files

IMPORTANT: Make sure bistream generation has SPI 4X
selected in the project's settings.  Otherwise, the
bitstream will not load since the FPGA is configured
for 4X SPI.

This design ended up being very congested and not all routing
attempts will result in a good build.  Need to sweep seeds
(and possibly optimization levels) to get a good build.

These timing violations are okay...

Launch Clock  : clk_dot4x_pal (RISE)

Reason        : There are at least 2 ticks of dot4x before reading the data out port. So as
                long as the slack is not excessive, it is okay.
