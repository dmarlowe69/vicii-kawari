# MAINLG-DVI:29MHZ:U
#    Unscaled output. Irregular resolutions. This is/was the default
#    for many releases. The resolutions are not compatible with some
#    monitors.  This has the DVI build identifier.
#
# MAINLG-DVI:27MHZ:U
#    This is identical to the 29MHZ version above except the PAL dot
#    clock is reduced to 27MHZ for a 720x576 resolution that is more
#    compatible with many TVs/monitors.  However, the drawback is
#    the visible region is stretched too much horizontally. The
#    output is not scaled as above. Never released.
#
# MAINLG-DVI:27MHZ:S
#    This is identical to the 27MHZ version above except both NTSC
#    and PAL displays go through a 10 to 9 scaler to get a better
#    aspect ratio.  This has the added benefit of being more
#    compatible as in the 27MGZ:U version but the scaling won't
#    work well for any hires modes (80 column or 640x200). It is
#    offered as an alternative to the default 29MHZ:U build and
#    is given a DVS build identifier.
#
# MAINLG-RGB:32MHZ:U
#    This the one and only full resolution analog RGB build.
